# Architecture. (required)
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. arch: ${GOARCH}
# The architecture is specified using Go nomenclature (GOARCH) and translated
# to the platform specific equivalent. In order to manually set the architecture
# to a platform specific value, set `{format}.arch`.
# Examples: `all`, `amd64`, `386`, `arm5`, `arm6`, `arm7`, `arm64`, `mips`,
# `mipsle`, `mips64le`, `ppc64le`, `s390`
# Currently supported: amd64 & arm64

# Version. (required)

# Version Release, aka revision.
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. release: ${VERSION_RELEASE}
# This is appended to the `version` after `prerelease`. This should be
# incremented if you release an updated package of the same upstream version,
# and it should reset to 1 when bumping the version.

# also call for a multi-line description starting on the second line.
